Delegation allows you to create rules across multiple records, allowing for complex permissions to be defined.

<Note>
  Delegation rules must always end in a [PublicKey](/collections#public-key) field. You must
   [authenticate the user with using a `signer`](/authentication) function in order to use delegation.
</Note>

You can annotate your collections with `@read`, `@call` and `@delegate` directives to control who can read, call and delegate data.
