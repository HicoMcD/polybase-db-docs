There are four ways to control who can [read](/read) and [write](/write) data in Polybase:

 1. [Allow all](#allow-all) (read and write) - allow anyone to read data and/or call collection functions

 1. [Delegation](#delegation) (read and write) - using `@read`, `@call` and `@delegate` directives

 2. [Code](#code) (write only) - write code to check users permissions in collection functions
 
 3. [Encryption](#encryption) (read only) - data is public but encrypted, only authorized users can decrypt it

<Note>
  For read rules, the entire record is always returned. There is no way to define read rules for specific fields. 
  If you need to have some restricted data, create a separate collection and create a link between the collections.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Unless otherwise defined, all collections are private and fully restricted meaning no-one can read data or call 
  collection functions. See [Allow all](#allow-all) to provide public access.
</Warning>

## Allow all

If you want to allow anyone to read data and/or call contract data, you can add one of the following 
directives at the top of your collection: 

 - `@public` - everyone can read and call any function
 - `@read` - everyone can read
 - `@call` - everyone can call any function

<Snippet file="permissions/read-on-collections.mdx" /> 

<Snippet file="permissions/call-on-collections.mdx" /> 


## Delegation

<Snippet file="permissions/delegate/desc.mdx" /> 

<Snippet file="permissions/read-on-fields.mdx" />

<Snippet file="permissions/call-on-functions.mdx" />

### `@delegate` + `@read`

<Snippet file="permissions/delegate/delegate-read.mdx" />

### `@delegate` + `@call`

<Snippet file="permissions/delegate/delegate-call.mdx" />


## Code

If you need more granular control over who can write data and call functions in Polybase, you can allow anyone to call
the collection functions, but then write code to check the user's permissions in the collection functions.

<Note>
This can only be used to control call/write access to Polybase, not read access.
</Note>

```js
@public
collection Team {
  id: string
  members: string[]
  publicKey: PublicKey;

  // Anyone can call this function because of @public on collection
  addMember (id: string) {
    // But you must be signing using the correct key
    if (this.publicKey == ctx.publicKey) {
       throw error('invalid user');
    }

    // And there must not be already more than 5 members
    if (this.members.length > 5) {
      throw error('too many members');
    }

    // Now we have checked rules, we can write the data
    this.members.push(id);
  }
}
```

## Encryption

You can make your data public (using the `@public` directive) but encrypted. This means that anyone can read the data, but only authorized 
users can decrypt it. 

For more information on encrypting data, see the [Encryption](/encryption) guide.
