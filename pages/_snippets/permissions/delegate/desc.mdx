Delegation allows you to create rules across multiple records, allowing for complex permissions to be defined.

A Polybase `collection` is just like an Ethereum `contract`, but instead of being for a single record, collections describes the rules for a set of records.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Delegation rules must always end in a [PublicKey](/guides/collections#public-key) field. You must
   [authenticate the user with using a `signer`](/guides/authentication) function in order to use delegation.
</Callout>

You can annotate your collections with `@read`, `@call` and `@delegate` directives to control who can read, call and delegate data.
