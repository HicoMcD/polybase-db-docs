### `@public` on collections

Allows anyone to read all records and call functions in the collection (it's the equivalent of adding `@read` and `@call`). 
You can still further restrict write permissions by adding custom code to your [collections functions](#functions).

```js
@public
collection Response {
  ...
}
```
