# Indexer Network

As Polybase DB infrastructure progresses towards more decentralization, client
libraries will communicate directly with the peer-to-peer Polybase DB indexer
network. The indexers store, index and allow you to query your data. More
information on the architecture of the network can be found in the
[whitepaper](https://polybase.xyz/whitepaper).

Currently in the Alpha release, Polybase DB is running indexers in-house for speed
of development. We provide access to these indexers through a hosted service at
`testnet.polybase.xyz`. You can always view the network status using the
[Polybase DB Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.polybase.xyz).
