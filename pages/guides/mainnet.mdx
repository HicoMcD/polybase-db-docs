# Private Mainnet

The Polybase Mainnet is currently invite-only. If you have a production use case and would like to join the private mainnet, please [apply here](https://ask.polybase.xyz/mainnet).

## Configuring the SDK

To connect to the Polybase Mainnet, you will need to configure the SDK with the following parameters:

```js
import { Polybase } from "@polybase/client";

const db = new Polybase({ 
  baseURL: "https://mainnet.polybase.xyz/v0",
  defaultNamespace: "your-namespace" 
});

// Now you can use the SDK as normal
await db.collection("City").call("setCountry", ["USA"]);
```
