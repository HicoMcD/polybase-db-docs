# Gateway API Overview

The Polybase Gateway REST API provides a convinent way to access the Polybase decentralized network.

<Warning>
While the Polybase network is in Alpha, the gateway is the only way to access the Polybase network. We will shortly be adding p2p access to the network.

## Authentication

The Polybase Gatweay API uses public/private key pair for authentication. That means it works natively with wallets like Metamask.

Authentication is composed of:

 - `v` the version being used, should be `v=0` 
 - `t` current unix timestamp in milliseconds
 - `h` type of hash signing being used `eth-personal-sign` is currently the only allowed option
 - `sig` the signature of the data (see below)
 - `pk` **optional** 64 byte public key (secp256k1 algorithm)


An example of a valid authroization:

```
v=0,t=1671884992,h=eth-personal-sign,sig=0x288db6271d92253ae19983a8e5110f1bc1bef1911210127ccbf657d85428ba9917aa9457f0f8e7f300a36b106525d3a3471e63ae265af4898742040a377e1da11c
```

The token is passed in the `X-Polybase-Signature` header of the request.


### Signature (`sig`)

To generate `sig` you must sign a string in the format `<timestamp>.<body_json>`. Where `timestamp` is the `t` you provided above, and `body_json` is the body of the request (as a JSON string).

You can use the [@polybase/util](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polybase/util) package to generate the signature from any 32 bytes private key, and the sign function to create the signature.

```typescript
import { secp256k1 } from '@polybase/util'

// You can use any 32 byte private key from any library, 
// here is an example from @polybase/util
let private_key = secp256k1.generatePrivateKey();

function createSig (timestamp, body) {
  const str_to_sign = `${timestamp}.${JSON.stringify(body)}`;
  return secp256k1.sign(privateKey, str_to_sign);
}
```
