# Getting started

### Spacetime is a decentralized database that lets developers build decentralized apps with trustless automation at 1000x lower cost than on-chain storage.

:::info
Spacetime is better than a web2 DB like Firebase üî• or Postgres üêò because you can encrypt data using wallets üí≥ for "user owned data" and verifiably query Spacetime from smart contracts üìú (coming soon).

Spacetime is also better than storing data on-chain ‚õì because it's 1000 to a million times cheaper than on-chain storage. For example, storing 1mb on Ethereum costs around $64,000 üí∏. 
:::

Blockchains are not built for scalable structured data storage so we built Spacetime to combine the best attributes of web2 databases and blockchains ü§ó.

## Install Spacetime Node/Browser client

```bash
npm install @spacetimexyz/client
```
```bash
yarn add @spacetimexyz/client
```

## Initialize the library

```ts
import { Spacetime } from '@spacetimexyz/client/web'
// import { Spacetime } from '@spacetimexyz/client/node' for nodejs

const db = new Spacetime({
  defaultNamespace: "your-namespace"
})
```

:::note
Namespace must be used for collections. If you specify a defaultNamespace, it will be automatically added for you for all collection calls.
:::

## Create a collection

You can create a collection using the library.

:::info
Creating a collection via the [Spacetime Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.spacetime.xyz) is coming soon.
:::

```ts
const createResponse = await db.applySchema(`
  collection Cities {
    id: string!;
    name: string;
    country: string;

    @index(name);
  }
`, 'your-namespace') // your-namespace is optional if you have defined a default namespace
```

For more details on creating collections, see the [collection](/collections) overview.

## Write data to a collection

```ts
await db.collection('your-namespace/Cities').doc('new-york').set({ 
  name: 'New York',
  country: 'USA'
})
```

:::note
Now go view the collection in the [Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.spacetime.xyz).
:::

## Read a document

```ts
const data = await db.collection('your-namespace/Cities').doc('new-york').get()
```
