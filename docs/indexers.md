# Indexer Network

As Polybase infrastructure progresses towards more decentralization, client libraries will communicate directly with the peer-to-peer Polybase indexer network. The indexers store, index and allow you to query your data. More information on the architecture of the network can be found in the [whitepaper](https://polybase.xyz/Polybase_A_Decentralised_Query_Index_and_Storage_Protocol-v2.0.pdf).

Currently in the Alpha release, Polybase is running indexers in-house for speed of development. We provide access to these indexers through a hosted service at `testnet.polybase.xyz`. You can always view the network status using the [Polybase Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.polybase.xyz).
